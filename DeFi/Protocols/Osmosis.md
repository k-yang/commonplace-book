# What is Osmosis?

Many AMMs are plagued by short-term mercenary farming, in which liquidity providers quickly remove and add back liquidity from pools in pursuit of the best yields. If enough LPs are engaging in short-term yield strategies, it can cause a serious disruption to the quality of the AMM. Liquidity within pools becomes volatile, resulting in an inconsistent and unreliable trading experience for users.

Osmosis wants to build a platform conducive to Long-Term Liquidity through two mechanisms: Exit Fees and Bonded Liquidity Gauges.


# Bonded Liquidity Gauges
Bonded Liquidity Gauges are mechanisms for distributing liquidity incentives to LP tokens that have been bonded for a minimum amount of time. 45% of the daily issuance of OSMO goes towards these liquidity incentives.
