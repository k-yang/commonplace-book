# What is Dai?
Dai is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar. Dai is designed to minimize price volatility.

Users generate Dai by depositing collateral assets into Maker Vaults within the Maker Protocol. Each collateral asset deposited requires its own Vault, so some users will own multiple Vaults with different types of collateral and levels of collateralization.
