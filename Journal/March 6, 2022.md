Fuck Amy and Andrew. I didn't do anything wrong and they kicked me out for a stupid reason (because they wanted extra space). They weren't very mindful when they did it either because I had just broken up with Melvina and they knew about that. I have come to learn that they aren't great people and it is okay to hate them. I don't have to sacrifice my own mental and emotional well-being and become like a monk to forgive them. The days of change are here.
