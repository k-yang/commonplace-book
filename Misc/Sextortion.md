# What to do next time when being sextorted/blackmailed
1. Don't send any money. Ever. The extortionist will always ask for more. Don't even send test payments. It lets the blackmailer believe you have the capacity to send funds so they will be clingy and persistent.
2. Block/ghost them right away. They are experts at psychological warfare and will push your buttons to elicit a response and try to get you to bend over. Keep this in mind as you are engaging with them and try to disengage as soon as possible.
3. Will they leak your stuff? Most likely not. It's a lot of time and effort on their part and they are likely operating a scamming business, so they have other victims to deal with. Also leaving the photos/videos on their computer is evidence for authorities, so they will likely eventually delete it anyways. They will only keep your stuff if they think they can get money from you in the future, which is why you should never pay them in the first place (see Rule 1).
4. Stay away from Digital Forensics Corp and its subsidiaries. They are a bunch of fear mongering scammers. 
5.
