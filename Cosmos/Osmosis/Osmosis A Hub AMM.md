# Osmosis: A Hub AMM
## Iterate Fast
Osmosis is an AMM laboratory. It allows for open and permissionless creation of AMMs with configurable parameters. As such, it should allow DeFi "scientists" to experiment and draw conclusions quickly.

## Specialized Governance and Incentive Alignment
OSMO is distributed to LPs so that they can govern the protocol. Osmosis believes LPs are at the heart of the protocol. The governance token distribution also serves the dual purpose of acting as a liquidity mining incentive. 

## Hub as an Application-Specific Blockchain
The Cosmos Hub is an application-specific blockchain so it shouldn't contain every feature in the Cosmos ecosystem. Specifically, it doesn't make sense to run Osmosis on the Cosmos Hub as a module since it would slow down the network and increase costs, creating bottlenecks. Instead of hosting a trading protocol, the Cosmos Hub should be dedicated to what it was originally designed for, such as Shared Security.

## Shared Security
Shared security allows zones to delegate their consensus security to Cosmos Hub validators, effectively allowing validators and delegators to use their ATOMs to secure multiple chains and earning more fees and rewards. 

## Credible Neutrality
The Cosmos Hub shouldn't compete with any other chain's product, because it makes shared security much less compelling for that chain. To be the best possible platform for people to build on top of, the Cosmos hub shouldn't try to compete with products. 

## Base Money and Staking Derivatives
One exception to the neutrality mentioned above is the base asset (staking token ATOM) as being a reserve asset in all the other chains through IBC. Features like Staking Derivatives and liquid staking will allow staked ATOMs to flow into other chains to be a core asset.
