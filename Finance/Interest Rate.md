# What is an interest rate?
The interest rate is the amount a lender charges a borrower and is a percentage of the principalâ€”the amount loaned. The interest rate on a loan is typically noted on an annual basis known as the [annual percentage rate (APR)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp).

Interest is essentially a charge to the borrower for the use of an asset. Assets borrowed can include cash, consumer goods, vehicles, and property.

For loans, the interest rate is applied to the principal, which is the amount of the loan. The interest rate is the [cost of debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofdebt.asp) for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. The money to be repaid is usually more than the borrowed amount since lenders require compensation for the loss of use of the money during the loan period. The lender could have invested the funds during that period instead of providing a loan, which would have generated income from the asset. The difference between the total repayment sum and the original loan is the interest charged.
