What is reality? I pondered this question while I was tripping on acid and the thought hit me as so meta that I couldn't really fathom it, and I thought to myself that pursuing down this trail of thought would turn me schizophrenic or psychotic or something. My fear of jumping down this rabbit hole took me over and that rabbit hole is gone for now. The fear of losing my grip on reality. Perhaps a bit too adventurous for me right now.
