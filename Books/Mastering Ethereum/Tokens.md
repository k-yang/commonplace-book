# Tokens
Commonly used to refer to special-purpose, privately-issued, coin-like items with insignificant intrinsic value. On blockchain, they are abstractions that can be owned and represent assets, currency, or access rights. On blockchain, the insignificant value expectation is a thing of the past because blockchain tokens can serve multiple purposes globally and can be exchanged for other tokens.

## Fungibility
Property of a good or commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable.
Non-fungible tokens are tokens that represent a unique tangible or intangible item and are therefore not interchangeable.

## Counterparty Risk
When an asset is traded indirectly through the exchange of token ownership, there is counterparty risk on the side of the custodian of the asset. How can you trust that they will hand over the asset?

## Intrinsicality
Some tokens represent digital items intrinsic to the blockchain (e.g. CryptoKitty) and are governed by consensus rules, so there is no counterparty risk. Other tokens represent extrinsic assets (e.g. gold bars) in which there is a non-blockchain entity who is the custodian of the asset, which has counterparty risk. 

Blockchain technology allows the conversion of extrinsic assets into intrinsic assets, for example, the conversion of equity in a corporation (extrinsic) to voting shares in a DAO (intrinsic). 

## Utility or Equity
Tokens are used as either utility tokens or as equity tokens. Sometimes the two are conflated.

Utility tokens are where the use of the token is required to gain access to some resource, application, or service. 

Equity tokens represent shares in control or ownership of something. 

## ERC-721
Non-fungible Token Standard (deeds)
Non-fungible tokens track ownership of a unique thing (digital item in game, art, etc.)

# Token Standards
Token standards are the minimum specifications for an implementation. Standards encourage interoperability between contracts. All other infrastructure components can interface predictably with any contract that follows the specification.
