# What is a DEX?
A DEX is a decentralized exchange. It allows two parties to trade assets without a centralized party/custodian. It doesn't have the drawbacks of centralized exchanges, like KYC and withdrawal limits.

There are two types of DEXs: order book based and liquidity pools.

# Order Book
An order book based DEX operates like a CEX, where users can place buy and sell orders and get matched up with corresponding users. The difference between a DEX and CEX is that in a DEX, the assets remain in the users' wallets until the trade goes through.

Order book based DEXs can be expensive because of the extra smart contract calls required to place orders.

# Liquidity Pools
[[Liquidity Pools]] are a new invention in DeFi that solve the problems with order book based exchanges. Liquidity pools are pools of assets stored in a smart contract that create liquidity for assets. Liquidity providers (people who put their assets in these DEX smart contracts) are rewarded in transaction fees and sometimes extra tokens that represent ownership of the pool (LP Tokens).

[[AMMs]] power DEXs by allowing assets to be traded against a liquidity pool counterparty, instead of a centralized custodian.
