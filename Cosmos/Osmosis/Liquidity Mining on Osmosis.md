# Liquidity Mining
The largest allocation of OSMO tokens is set aside for liquidity incentives for LPs.

LPing is the process of allocating assets into an AMM liquidity pool. 

Users pay a fee to swap with liquidity pools, which go back to LPs. 

LPs take on risk in the form of impermanent loss, which is the difference in net worth between holding and LPing. Liquidity mining helps offset losses due to impermanent loss (and also transaction fees). 

Bonded liquidity gauges are mechanisms for distributing liquidity incentives to LP tokens that have been bonded for a minimum amount of time. Basically an LP bonds their LP tokens to a gauge for up to two weeks and receive liquidity incentives. 45% of daily OSMO issuance goes to these liquidity incentives.
