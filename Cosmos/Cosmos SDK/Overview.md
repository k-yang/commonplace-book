# Cosmos SDK
Developers create the application layer using the Cosmos SDK. The Cosmos SDK provides a scaffold to get started and a rich set of modules. The creation of an application-specific blockchain with the Cosmos SDK is largely a process of selecting, configuring, and integrating well-solved modules also known as composing modules.

# How to create a Cosmos blockchain app
- Create modules in x/`moduleName`
- Register the module in `app.go`
