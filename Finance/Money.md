# What is money?
[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money.asp)

Money primary functions as a medium of exchange. It solves the double coincidence of wants problem prevalent in barter economies. Money has also developed secondary purposes:
1. unit of account
2. store of value
3. standard of deferred payment

# Unit of Account
Due to its use as a medium of exchange for both buying and selling and its use to assign prices to all kinds of other goods and services, money can be used to keep track of the money gained or lost across multiple transactions, and to compare money values of various combinations of different quantities of different goods and services mathematically.

# Store of Value
Because money's usefulness as a medium of exchange in transactions is inherently future-oriented, it provides a means to store value obtained through current production or trade for use in the future in the form of other goods and services.

# Standard of Deferred Payment
To the extent that money is accepted as a general medium of exchange and serves as a useful store of value, it can be used to transfer value for exchange use at different times between people through the tools of credit and debt.
