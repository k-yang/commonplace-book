# What are AMMs?
AMMs are decentralized finance protocols that allow for the swapping of assets without a centralized intermediary. Just as trading firms make traditional markets, AMMs establish prices and facilitate trades using permissionless liquidity pools into which users can deposit assets.

AMM is a mathematical function to price assets algorithmically based on liquidity pools. [Source](https://medium.com/coinmonks/dexs-and-amms-c79bce065703)

An automated market maker (AMM) is a tool used to provide liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi). They are used to enable the automatic trading of digital assets. They do this by using liquidity pools as a replacement for traditional buyer and seller markets. [Source](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm-588954fc5ff7)

"An automated market maker (AMM) is the underlying protocol that powers a decentralized exchange (DEX) by enabling assets to be traded by using crypto liquidity pools as counterparties, instead of a traditional market of buyers and sellers."
