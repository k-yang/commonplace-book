Seigniorage is the difference between the face value of money, such as a $10 bill or a quarter coin, and the cost to produce it. In other words, the economic cost of producing a currency within a given economy or country is lower than the actual exchange value, which generally accrues to governments who mint the money.

If the seigniorage is positive, the government will make an [economic profit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicprofit.asp); while a negative seigniorage will result in an economic loss.
