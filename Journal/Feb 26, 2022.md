Unique is kind of a cyborg. He has so many efficient systems to optimize productivity in life. Here are some of the ones that he gave me today:
- GTD - getting things done
- Todoist

Getting distracted is so easy. One minute I was researching productivity systems, the next I was texting Julie. I think it's too easy to get distracted when I have my social media apps open at the same time as when I'm trying to be productive. I've noticed that multiple times today. I think it's time to get rid of them while I'm working. I noticed that Unique is offline on Discord for the majority of the day, and only comes on late at night when he wants to work in a group.

I think it's okay to log back onto the social media apps when I'm on a break (~15-20 mins), but I should close them again when I'm back in work mode.
