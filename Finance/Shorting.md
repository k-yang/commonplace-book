# What is short selling
Short selling is an investment or trading strategy that speculates on the decline in a stock or other security's price.

In short selling, a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock or other asset that the investor believes will decrease in value. The investor then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay the market price. Before the borrowed shares must be returned, the trader is betting that the price will continue to decline and they can purchase them at a lower cost.

The most common reasons for engaging in short selling are speculation and hedging. A speculator is making a pure price bet that it will decline in the future. People may also sell short in order to hedge a long position.
