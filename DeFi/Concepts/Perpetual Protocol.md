# vAMMs
[Docs](https://docs.perp.fi/getting-started/how-it-works/vamm)
- Perpetual protocol does not use liquidity or LPs
- There are no order books, it is AMM based
- The price reflects protocol trades, the price only moves when positions are opened or closed

Traders use USDC to open long or short positions. Every time a trade is made, the vAMM calculates the entry or exit price of the position.

The vAMM expands the AMM application from token swaps to derivatives, like perpetual contracts. vAMMs are used to swap virtual, synthetic assets like derivatives contracts. No real assets are stored in the vAMM itself, so there are no liquidity pools. 

# Perpetual Contracts
A perpetual contract is a derivative similar to a futures contract but without an expiry date.
