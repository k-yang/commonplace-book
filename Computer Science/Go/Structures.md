Go isn't an object-oriented language. It doesn't have objects or inheritance, so it doesn't have OO. concepts such as polymorphism and overloading.

Go has structures, which can be associated with methods. Go also has composition.

# Declarations and Initializations
A pointer is a memory address; it's the location of where to find the actual value. It's a level of indirection. It's the difference between being at a house and having directions to the house.

Go always passes arguments as copies to a function. 

# Functions on Structures

# Constructors

# New
The result of new(X) is the same as &X{}

# Fields of a Structure
# Composition
Implicit composition is just a compiler trick and we can implicitly or explicitly access the fields and functions of the composed type.

# Pointers versus Values
