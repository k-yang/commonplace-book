A derivative refers to a type of financial contract whose value is dependent on an underlying asset, group of assets, or benchmark.

Underlying assets are the financial assets upon which a derivative's price is based. Underlying assets could be securities in a company, futures?, commodities, currency, or indexes.

# Options
Options are an example of a derivative. Options on a stock give the holder the right to buy or sell the stock at the strike price up until expiration. The underlying asset for the option is the stock.

An [options contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) is similar to a futures contract in that it is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date for a specific price. The key difference between options and futures is that with an option, the buyer is not obliged to exercise their agreement to buy or sell. It is an opportunity only, not an obligation, as futures are.

An American option allows holders to exercise the option rights at any time before and including the day of expiration. A European optionÂ can be executed only on the day of expiration.

## Put Option
Right to sell a certain number of shares at a specific price (strike price) up until a specified date in the future (expiration date). See protective put.

## Call Option
Gives the right to buy a stock at a strike price until a specified date.

# Futures
Futures are derivatives that obligate the parties to transact an asset at a predetermined future date and price. The difference between an option and a future is that in a future, the parties are obligated whereas in an option, the option contract holder is not obligated.

# Swaps
[Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp) are another common type of derivative, often used to exchange one kind of cash flow with another.
